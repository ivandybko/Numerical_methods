In this paper, the Gaussian elimination method with partial selection of the main element is implemented for $$ n \cross n $$, and the possibility of finding a solution using QR decomposition is also realized. In addition, the program calculates the condition number of the system and the norm of residual between the original vector of the right side and the one obtained after substituting the found solution into the system. Also, an arbitrary perturbation of the vector of the right side is introduced into the system to assess the stability of the methods.
